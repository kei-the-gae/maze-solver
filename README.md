# Maze Solver

This is a [guided project](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-maze-solver-python) I completed as a part of the Boot.dev back-end developer curriculum. The project is a maze solver that uses a recursive depth-first search algorithm to find a path from the start to the end of a maze. It is intended to demonstrate the use of recursion and data structures.

## Features

- Recursive depth-first search algorithm
- Visualization of the maze and the path found

## Usage

Python is required to run the static site generator.

Clone the repository and run the following command from the root directory:

```bash
python3 main.py
```
